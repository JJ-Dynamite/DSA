# Here are some key concepts and operations that you might want to focus on:

1. Graph Representation: Understanding how to represent a graph in various ways, such as an `adjacency matrix or adjacency list`, is essential.

2. Graph Traversal Algorithms: Like trees, understanding how to traverse a graph in various orders (`depth-first search, breadth-first search`) is essential for many graph-based problems.

3. Shortest Path Algorithms: Graphs are commonly used in finding the shortest path between two points in a network, so understanding algorithms such as `Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm` can be very useful.

4. Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms: Finding a minimum spanning tree is another important application of graphs, and algorithms such as `Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm` are commonly used for this purpose.

5. Network Flow Algorithms: Network flow algorithms such as `Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and Edmonds-Karp algorithm` are important for solving optimization problems on graphs such as maximum flow and minimum cut.
