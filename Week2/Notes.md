- **Stack overflow** occurs when a program tries to use more memory space than the call stack has available. In contrast, a **stack underflow** happens when a program tries to pop an item from an empty stack.

- A **stack** is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. A **queue**, on the other hand, follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

- **Recursion** is a programming technique where a function calls itself. The call stack is used to keep track of the recursive function calls.

- **Breadth-first search (BFS)** and **depth-first search (DFS)** are graph traversal algorithms. BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited, while DFS uses a stack.

- A **hash table** is a data structure that allows fast data retrieval. When two or more keys hash to the same index, it's called a **collision**. There are several methods to solve collisions, including **linear probing**, **quadratic probing**, and **double hashing**.

- **Merge sort**, **insertion sort**, and **quick sort** are sorting algorithms. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), while insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2). Quick sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), but its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2).
