- Implement a doubly linked list. A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node also has a pointer to the previous node. You will need to implement methods such as push, pop, shift, unshift, delete and count for the list.


- Reverse a linked list. Given a singly linked list, write a function that reverses the order of the nodes and returns the new head of the list.


- Detect a cycle in a linked list. A cycle occurs when a node in a linked list points to a node that was already visited. Write a function that returns true if a linked list contains a cycle and false otherwise.
